# üöÄ Neothink Monorepo Launch Checklist

This checklist ensures your monorepo of 4 Vercel apps, powered by a shared Supabase backend, is fully production-ready and delivers a magnetic, delightful experience for users and admins.

---

## 1. Monorepo & Build Health
- [ ] All packages and apps build cleanly (`pnpm build`)
- [ ] All TypeScript types are correct and exported
- [ ] No unresolved imports/exports
- [ ] No dead code or ambiguous dependencies

- [ ] All Vercel projects have correct env vars set
- [ ] No secrets in public code or version control

## 3. Supabase Configuration
- [ ] Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables (see summary below)
- [ ] RLS policies are granular (one per operation/role)
- [ ] Policies reviewed for both `anon` and `authenticated` roles
- [ ] Supabase redirect URLs set for each app:
  - Production, Preview, Local

### RLS Policy Coverage Summary

| Schema   | Table                    | RLS Enabled | Notes                          |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| auth     | users                    | ‚úÖ          | User login data                |
| public   | user_profiles            | ‚úÖ          | User profile data              |
| public   | xp_events                | ‚úÖ          | Gamification event logs        |

| auth     | settings                 | ‚ùå          | System config table            |

- For any table without RLS, document the rationale in `/supabase/migrations/` and/or here.

## 4. CI/CD & Deployment

- [ ] Launch checklist reviewed and completed

---

## Final Pre-Launch Steps
