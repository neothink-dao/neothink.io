## Security & Authorization Onboarding

### Running the RLS Audit and Documentation Generator
- To generate and audit RLS policy documentation, run:
  ```sh
  pnpm run rls:docs
  ```
- This will update `docs/security/rls-policies.md` and output a list of tables missing RLS to `docs/security/rls-missing.md`.
- Review `rls-missing.md` after any schema or migration changes.

### Updating or Adding RLS/RBAC Policies
- Make changes to RLS or RBAC policies via Supabase migrations or dashboard.
- After any policy change, always run the RLS doc generator and review the output.
- Document new or updated policies in the appropriate markdown files.

### Checklist After DB/Policy Changes
- [ ] Run `pnpm run rls:docs` and review both `rls-policies.md` and `rls-missing.md`.
- [ ] Update documentation for any new/changed policies.
- [ ] Ensure no sensitive tables are missing RLS.
- [ ] Commit and push documentation updates.

### Requesting a Security Review
- Open a GitHub issue with the `security` label or contact a project admin.
- Include details of the change and any new policies or sensitive data flows.
