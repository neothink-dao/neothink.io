# Neothink DAO Governance & Project Management

This project is fully owned, controlled, and managed by the Neothink DAO. All code, schema, and documentation changes are subject to DAO governance, ensuring transparency, security, and community alignment.

## Principles
- **Decentralized Ownership:** All major decisions are made by DAO vote.
- **Transparent Change Management:** All code and schema changes are discussed and approved via public proposals and PRs.
- **Open Collaboration:** Anyone may propose improvements; contributors are onboarded by DAO process.
- **Security & Compliance:** All migrations, RLS, and policies are reviewed for production safety and privacy.

## Governance Workflow
1. **Proposal:** Any contributor may submit a proposal (issue or PR) for schema/code changes.
2. **Discussion:** The DAO community reviews, discusses, and iterates on the proposal.
3. **Voting:** Proposals are approved/rejected by DAO vote (see on-chain/off-chain process).
4. **Implementation:** Approved changes are merged and deployed by maintainers.
5. **Audit:** Regular audits ensure codebase, database, and docs remain in sync and production-ready.

## Contributor Onboarding
- Read the main README and schema docs.
- Submit an introduction and intent to contribute.
- Follow the DAO onboarding process.

## Contact & Participation
- For governance questions, open an issue or reach out via DAO communication channels.
- All work is public and open for review by the DAO and community.
