# Neothink DAO Monorepo

> **Current Governance:**
> Joshua Seymour is the benevolent dictator and steward of the Neothink DAO. The long-term goal is for the DAO to fully govern itself and all its assets through decentralized, transparent processes.

This monorepo/turborepo contains 4 Vercel apps/sites, all sharing a single production-grade Supabase database. **All code, schema, and documentation are owned, governed, and managed by the Neothink DAO.**

## Key Principles
- **DAO Governance:** All changes are subject to DAO approval and transparent governance.
- **Database as Code:** All schema changes are managed via migrations and version-controlled.
- **Code/DB Sync:** TypeScript types, schema, and documentation are always kept in sync.
- **User/Admin Delight:** The stack is designed for maximum engagement, clarity, and security for both users and admins.

## Database Schema & ER Diagram
- See [`supabase/schema/schema.sql`](./supabase/schema/schema.sql) for the full authoritative DDL.
- See [`supabase/schema/er_diagram.dbml`](./supabase/schema/er_diagram.dbml) for a visual ER diagram (import to [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io)).
- All tables, relationships, and RLS policies are documented in migrations and the schema folder.

## DAO Governance & Policies
- See [`DAO_GOVERNANCE.md`](./DAO_GOVERNANCE.md) for details on how the DAO manages this project, voting, and contributor onboarding.

## Onboarding & Contribution
- See [`supabase/schema/README.md`](./supabase/schema/README.md) for schema/ERD usage.
- All contributors must follow DAO guidelines and submit PRs for review.

## üöÄ Overview

The Neothink Platform consists of four main applications that share a common infrastructure:

- **Hub** (`apps/hub`): The main platform and entry point
- **Ascenders** (`apps/ascenders`): Advanced learning and growth
- **Neothinkers** (`apps/neothinkers`): Community and collaboration
- **Immortals** (`apps/immortals`): Premium features and experiences

All applications share:
- A single Supabase project for data and authentication
- Common UI components and utilities
- Shared authentication and security
- Unified monitoring and analytics

## üì¶ Package Management

We use pnpm workspaces to manage dependencies across the monorepo. Key commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

pnpm add -w <package>

# Add dependency to a specific package
pnpm add <package> --filter <package-name>

# Run command in all packages
pnpm -r <command>

# Run command in a specific package
pnpm --filter <package-name> <command>
```

## üîß Development

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev

# Production
pnpm build
pnpm start

# Specific app
pnpm dev:hub
pnpm dev:ascenders
pnpm dev:neothinkers
pnpm dev:immortals
```

### Database

```bash
# Generate types
pnpm db:generate

# Push migrations
pnpm db:push

# Open Supabase Studio

# Neothink Monorepo

This is a monorepo containing multiple Next.js applications for the Neothink ecosystem:

- **Hub** - The central hub application
- **Ascenders** - Ascenders platform
- **Neothinkers** - Neothinkers platform
- **Immortals** - Immortals platform

## Architecture

This monorepo uses:
- **Turborepo** for build orchestration
- **pnpm** for package management
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **Vercel** for deployment

## Development

To run the development server:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the development server for all apps
pnpm dev

# Run the development server for a specific app
pnpm dev --filter=@neothink/hub
```

## Deployment

### Automatic Deployments

The monorepo is configured to automatically deploy to Vercel through GitHub Actions when:
- Changes are pushed to the `main` branch
- The workflow is manually triggered

Each app is deployed independently based on which files have changed:
- Changes to `apps/{app}/**` will trigger a deployment for that app
- Changes to `packages/**` will trigger deployments for all apps

### Manual Deployments

To manually deploy an app:

```bash
# Install the Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy a specific app
cd apps/hub
vercel deploy
```

## GitHub Setup

To set up GitHub Actions for deployment, add the following secrets to your repository:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Your Vercel token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID` - Your Vercel organization ID
- `VERCEL_HUB_PROJECT_ID` - Project ID for Hub
- `VERCEL_ASCENDERS_PROJECT_ID` - Project ID for Ascenders
- `VERCEL_NEOTHINKERS_PROJECT_ID` - Project ID for Neothinkers
- `VERCEL_IMMORTALS_PROJECT_ID` - Project ID for Immortals

## Best Practices

- Always include packages with the `workspace:*` protocol
- Use Turborepo filtering for efficient builds (`--filter=...`)
- Write proper `turbo.json` pipeline dependencies
- Set up proper environment variables in Vercel UI

## Onboarding & Setup

Welcome to the Neothink monorepo! This repo contains all apps, packages, and shared types for the Neothink platform.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 9+
- GitHub account with access to this repo

### 1. Clone the Repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/neothink/your-monorepo.git
cd your-monorepo
```

### 2. Authenticate for GitHub Packages
To install private packages (like `@neothink/types`), you need a GitHub token:

1. [Create a Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `read:packages` scope.
2. Add this to your `~/.npmrc`:
   ```
   //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
   ```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```sh
pnpm install
```

### 4. Environment Variables
- Add your `.env` files for each app (see `.env.example` in each app directory).
- All secrets should be managed via Vercel or Supabase dashboards in production.

### 5. Common Scripts
- `pnpm dev` ‚Äî Start all apps in dev mode
- `pnpm build` ‚Äî Build all packages and apps
- `pnpm lint` ‚Äî Lint all code
- `pnpm type-check` ‚Äî Type-check all code
- `pnpm test` ‚Äî Run all tests

### 6. Running Locally
- Each app can be started individually from its directory with `pnpm dev`.
- The monorepo supports Turborepo for fast, cached builds and dev.

### 7. Deployments
- All apps are deployed via Vercel (see Vercel dashboard for project links).
- Database and auth are managed via Supabase.

### 8. Updating Shared Types
- Update types in `packages/types` and publish a new version to GitHub Packages.
- Bump the version in dependent packages and run `pnpm install`.
