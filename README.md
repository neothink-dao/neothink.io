# Neothink DAO Monorepo

# üè¢ Company Purpose

Neothink DAO is building the world‚Äôs first open, positive-sum network state platform‚Äîmagnetically attracting, engaging, and delighting users and admins through gamified, transparent, and collaborative systems for prosperity, happiness, longevity, and luckiness.

# üö© Problem

Today‚Äôs online communities and DAOs struggle with engagement, transparency, and sustainable governance. Most platforms are fragmented, lack user-centric design, and fail to reward meaningful contribution. Users and admins alike experience friction, unclear incentives, and limited ownership.

# üí° Solution

Neothink DAO unifies four flagship apps (Ascenders, Neothinkers, Immortals, Hub) into a living, evolving network state. Each app is a ‚Äúnetwork state experiment‚Äù powered by a shared Supabase database, universal onboarding, and fractal, meritocratic, and sociocratic governance. Our gamified system rewards positive-sum actions, transparent collaboration, and real-world impact‚Äîdelivering a uniquely magnetic user and admin experience that iterates based on open feedback and data.

# ‚è≥ Why Now?

The convergence of DAOs, network states, and composable Web3 tools makes it possible to build transparent, user-owned, and scalable digital societies. The world is hungry for new models of governance, engagement, and community‚Äîyet most solutions are still siloed, closed, or fragmented. Neothink DAO is the right project at the right time, leveraging the latest tech and governance research.

# üåç Market Potential

Our initial users are builders, researchers, DAO members, and open-source contributors seeking high-engagement, transparent, and rewarding communities. The broader market includes any community, DAO, or organization seeking to evolve into a network state. Neothink DAO aims to invent and lead the ‚Äúnetwork state platform‚Äù market.

# ü•ä Competition / Alternatives

Direct competitors include DAO platforms (e.g., DAOstack, Aragon), online community tools (e.g., Discord, Discourse), and emerging network state projects. Indirect competition includes legacy social networks and closed SaaS platforms. Neothink DAO wins by combining open research, composable tech, and a relentless focus on user/admin delight, transparency, and positive-sum incentives.

# üí∏ Business Model

Neothink DAO is a hybrid open-source and membership-driven platform. Revenue streams include premium memberships, governance tokens, consulting for network state launches, and custom integrations for aligned communities. All revenue is transparently managed by the DAO.

# üë• Team

- **Recognized Founder:** Mark Hamilton and the Hamilton Family
- **Main Steward:** Joshua Seymour (on behalf of the founder and active communities)
- **Core Contributors:** The most active members of the Neothink DAO and its aligned communities

# üìä Financials

Neothink DAO is pre-revenue and funded by the founder and early contributors. All financials, budgets, and treasury operations are transparently managed by the DAO and published in the governance docs.

# üöÄ Vision

In five years, Neothink DAO will have built the world‚Äôs most magnetic, rewarding, and transparent network state platform‚Äîpowering thousands of thriving communities and DAOs, recognized for its positive-sum impact, open research, and collaborative governance. The platform will be self-governing, with all key decisions made by the community, and will serve as a blueprint for digital societies worldwide.

> **New to the project? Start here:** See our [ONBOARDING.md](./ONBOARDING.md) for a fast, frustration-free setup and contribution guide.

> **Current Governance:**
> Joshua Seymour is the benevolent dictator and steward of the Neothink DAO. The long-term goal is for the DAO to fully govern itself and all its assets through decentralized, transparent processes.

This monorepo/turborepo contains 4 Vercel apps/sites, all sharing a single production-grade Supabase database. **All code, schema, and documentation are owned, governed, and managed by the Neothink DAO.**

## Key Principles
- **DAO Governance:** All changes are subject to DAO approval and transparent governance.
- **Database as Code:** All schema changes are managed via migrations and version-controlled.
- **Code/DB Sync:** TypeScript types, schema, and documentation are always kept in sync.
- **User/Admin Delight:** The stack is designed for maximum engagement, clarity, and security for both users and admins.

## ‚ú® User & Admin Experience (2025 Update)

**For Users:**
- Enjoy a seamless onboarding journey with progressive challenges and rewards.
- Track your progress, XP, points, and badges across all apps from a unified dashboard.
- Participate in cross-app challenges, earn bonuses, and climb the leaderboard.
- Transparent governance: vote, propose, and contribute to DAO decisions.
- Access clear guides, FAQs, and support for every step.

**For Admins:**
- Manage users, roles, and permissions with actionable dashboards.
- Configure and tune gamification rewards and multipliers per app.
- Monitor engagement, analytics, and system health in real time.
