# How the Game Works for Ascenders

Welcome, Ascender! As a value creator, your journey is about building prosperity for yourself and your community. Here’s how you can maximize your experience:

## 1. **Earning LUCK & LIVE Tokens**
- **LUCK**: Boost your luckiness by engaging in weekly events, completing quests, and collaborating with others.
- **LIVE**: Earn by building your business, completing Ascension platform challenges, and helping others grow.

## 2. **XP, Levels, and Badges**
- Every action (posting, commenting, referring, attending Zooms) earns you XP.
- Level up to unlock new features, recognition, and rewards.
- Badges celebrate milestones, streaks, and positive-sum actions.

- Attend weekly Zooms for bonus XP/tokens.

## 4. **Referrals & Team Wins**

- Join or form teams to multiply rewards through collaboration.

## 5. **Positive-Sum Game Theory**
