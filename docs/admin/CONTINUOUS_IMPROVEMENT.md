# Ritual Audits & Continuous Improvement

To ensure the Neothink ecosystem remains flawless, positive-sum, and delightful for all users, admins, and AI agents, we follow a ritual of continuous improvement:

## 1. **Quarterly Sacred Geometry Audit**
- **What:** Review all systems, docs, and user journeys for clarity, symmetry, and positive-sum alignment.
- **Who:** Core team + community contributors
- **How:** Use the [launch checklist](../deployment/launch-checklist.md) and [documentation standards](../standards/DOCUMENTATION-ORGANIZATION.md) as guides.
- **When:** Schedule at the start of each quarter (add to project management calendar or CI reminders).

## 2. **Feedback Loops Everywhere**
- Every doc, dashboard, and onboarding flow should have a clear way to [Suggest an Improvement](https://github.com/NeothinkDAO/your-repo/issues/new/choose) or submit feedback.
- Feedback is reviewed weekly and incorporated into the next audit cycle.

## 3. **How to Add or Improve Feedback Links**
- Use this Markdown snippet at the end of docs:

  ```md
  ## ðŸ’¡ Suggest an Improvement
  Found an error or want to improve this page? [Open an issue](https://github.com/NeothinkDAO/your-repo/issues/new/choose) or submit a pull request!
  ```

- For dashboards and UIs, add a feedback button linking to the same GitHub Issues page or in-app feedback form.

## 4. **Audit Checklist**
- [ ] All docs have feedback links
- [ ] All dashboards have feedback buttons
- [ ] Quarterly audit scheduled
- [ ] Feedback is reviewed and acted upon

> Continuous improvement is sacred. Ritual audits and feedback loops keep Neothink positive-sum, scalable, and delightful for all.
