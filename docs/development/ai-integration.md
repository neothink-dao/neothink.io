## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The AI integration follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **AI Service Layer**
   - Handles communication with external AI services
   - Manages API keys and authentication
   - Implements rate limiting and error handling

2. **Annotation Pipeline**
   - Data preprocessing and cleaning
   - Annotation workflow management
   - Quality control and validation

3. **Integration Points**
   - Platform Bridge integration
   - Database synchronization
   - Real-time processing capabilities

### Security Considerations

- API key management
- Data encryption
- Access control
- Audit logging

## Best Practices

1. **Data Management**
   - Regular backups
   - Data versioning
   - Cleanup procedures

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Caching strategies
   - Batch processing
   - Resource management

3. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Health checks
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. API Connection Issues
2. Performance Bottlenecks
