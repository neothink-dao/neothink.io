title: "Tokenomics Launch Simulation"

summary: "A simulation of user onboarding and token flow across four Neothink DAO apps, validating positive-sum game theory and cross-app consistency."
---

## Background
Neothink DAO aims to create a positive-sum, gamified ecosystem where users and admins are rewarded for meaningful participation. Before onboarding the first 100-1000 users, we simulated key flows to validate our tokenomics and cross-app data consistency.

## Methodology
- Simulated onboarding, posting, messaging, and event attendance across all four Vercel apps.
- Used a shared Supabase backend with hardened security and RLS.
- Tracked token balance changes, event logs, and error rates.

## Results
- All intended flows correctly awarded tokens and updated balances.
- No double-counting or exploits detected.
- Cross-app data consistency achieved.
- Identified a few edge cases for admin overrides and abuse prevention (see Issues).

## Learnings & Next Steps
- Continue to monitor for edge cases as user base grows.
- Expand simulation to cover more advanced gamification and admin flows.
- Encourage peer review and feedback on tokenomics logic.
