## 🏛️ Governance Model Explained

Neothink DAO uses a collaborative governance model combining:
- **Fractal:** Distributed, self-similar groups for decision-making
- **Meritocratic:** Influence and rewards based on meaningful contributions
- **Sociocratic:** Consent-based, peer-driven processes for evolving rules and structures

This model ensures fairness, adaptability, and positive-sum outcomes for all participants. [Read more...](../GOVERNANCE.md)
