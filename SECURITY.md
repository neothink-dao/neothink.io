# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep the Neothink DAO platform and its users safe!

## Supported Versions
We support the latest production deployments of all four Vercel projects (Hub, Immortals, Ascenders, Neothinkers) and all shared packages in this monorepo.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

- **Email:** security@neothink.io
- **GitHub Security Advisories:** [Create a private advisory](https://github.com/neothink-dao/neothink.io/security/advisories)
- **Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly** until we have addressed them and coordinated a release/patch.

We aim to respond to all security reports within 2 business days and resolve critical issues as quickly as possible.

## Our Security Principles
- **User and admin trust is paramount.**
- **All apps use centralized, robust middleware for authentication, rate limiting, and security headers.**
- **No secrets or credentials are ever hardcoded.**
- **We use automated dependency and secret scanning.**
- **We welcome responsible disclosure and will credit researchers if desired.**

## Hall of Fame
We are grateful to all security researchers and users who help keep our platform safe. If you wish to be recognized, let us know in your report!
